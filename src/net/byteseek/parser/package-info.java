 /**
  * net.byteseek.parser is a package primarily containing an interface for parsing strings into
  * an abstract syntax tree of type T, along with a ParseException if parsing fails.
  * <p>
  * A utility class, {@link net.byteseek.parser.StringParseReader} is also included, which can be used by parsers 
  * to provide reading functionality on a string. It maintains a current position in the string,
  * and has methods to peek ahead and behind and read positive integers, strings and hex values
  * directly parsed from the string.
