Syntax for byte-oriented regular expressions:
============================================

   * Put comments on a line using the # symbol.  Everything after a
     # up to the end of the line is a comment and is ignored,
     unless they are inside a quoted piece of text.

   * All spaces, tabs and new lines are also ignored,
     unless they are inside a quoted piece of text.

   * Bytes are written as 2 digit hexadecimal numbers (any case allowed)
     	00 FF 1a dE

   * Any byte can be matched using the full stop:
        .

   * Text (ASCII only) is delimited using single quotes:
    	'testing testing 123'

   * Case-insensitive text can be written delimited with back-ticks:
    	`HtMl public`

   * Alternatives are written separated by a pipe character:
    	'this' | 'that' | 00 FF 1a

   * Match more than one possible byte value with square brackets:
     	[09 0A 0D 20]         # whitespace - tab, newline, carriage return, space
        ['0'-'9']             # the digits 0 to 9
        [09 0A 0D 20 '0'-'9'] # whitespace or digits

     Or that anything but the specified bytes should match:
     	[^ 'a'-'z']           # anything except 'a' to 'z'

     Some common groups of bytes have named sets, for convenience:
	[ascii]     # all ascii chars                         [0-127]
	[print]     # all printable chars including space     [32-126]
	[graph]     # all visible chars (not including space) [33-126]
	[word]      # all characters, digits & underscore     ['0'-'9' 'a'-'z' 'A'-'Z' '_']
	[alnum]     # all characters & digits                 ['0'-'9' 'a'-'z' 'A'-'Z']
	[alpha]     # all alphabetic characters               ['a'-'z' 'A'-'Z']
	[upper]     # upper case characters only              ['A'-'Z']
	[lower]     # lower case characters only              ['a'-'z']
	[punct]     # all punctuation                         [
	[xdigit]    # a hexadecimal digit                     ['0'-'9' 'a'-'f' 'A'-'F']
	[digit]     # a digit                                 ['0'-'9']
	[ws]        # space, tab newline & return             [' ' 09 0a 0d]
	[blank]     # space & tab                             [' ' 09]
	[space]     # space                                   20
	[tab]       # tab                                     09
	[newline]   # newline                                 0a
	[return]    # carriage return                         0d
	[ctrl]      # 

     Standard shorthands are also defined for common regular expression bytes:
	\t	# tab			09
	\n	# newline		0a
	\v'	# vertical tab		0b
	\f'	# form feed		0c
	\r'	# carriage return	0d
	\e'	# escape		1b
	\d'	# digit                 [  '0'-'9']
	\D'	# not digit		[^ '0'-'9']
	\w'	# word character	[  'a'-'z' 'A'-'Z' '0'-'9' '_']
	\W'	# not word character	[^ 'a'-'z' 'A'-'Z' '0'-'9' '_']
	\s'	# white space		[  09 0a 0d 20]
	\S'	# not white space	[^ 09 0a 0d 20]

     All these shorthands can also be used inside or outside of square brackets,
        01 02 \t 03 04 newline space \D 7f 80 [ascii 80 81 82]

     But not inside text strings - you must put them outside the quotes:
        'looking for' tab 'this text after a tab' newline

   * Bitmasks (all the specified bits must match) are written:
     	&7F                   # match all these bits 01111111
        &0F                   # match all these bits 00001111
        &81                   # match all these bits 10000001

   * Bitmasks (any of the specified bits can match) are written:
        ~7F                   # match any of these bits 01111111
        ~0F                   # match any of these bits 00001111
        ~81                   # match any of these bits 10000001

   * Quantifiers: specify how many of the preceding expression must match:
     	Optional  	'that'?             0-1
	None or more  	[09 0a 0d 20]*      0-*
	One or more   	[09 0a 0d 20]+      1-*
	Exactly   	(fe ff){4}          n
	Between   	ff{3-8}             n-m
	At least  	ff{5-*}             n-*

   * Grouping: round brackets are used to group expressions:
     	('NUM' [30-39]+ )? ('XYZ' | '123' | 01 02 03 )
